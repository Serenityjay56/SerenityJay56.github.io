  <h2 class="container-block-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Serenity Hall, a 5th-year student at Michigan State University studying Data Science.  
    I love traveling and discovering new places â€” one of my biggest dreams is to visit Greece someday.  
    I used to live in Los Angeles, and during that time, I developed a deep love for nature and animals.  
    Outside of academics, I enjoy quiet moments spent in nature, learning new things, and connecting with others through shared experiences.
